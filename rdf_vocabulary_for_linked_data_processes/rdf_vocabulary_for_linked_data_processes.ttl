Note that uwrecon:targetVocab is favored above void:target and its subproperties when the resource being described is not part of a graph that is a void:Linkset. This property helps build a list of all targets used to insert related assertions about matching entities into the source dataset. This is useful when assertions (triples) are inserted into the source graph. Also note that the properties used to bring the source entities in relation to the target entities are described in uwrecon:linkPredicates." ;

The IRI is extracted from the target vocabulary to provide an additional description for a single resource already described in the source dataset, therefore not extracted as part of a comprehesive matching process. This property was created in addition to uwrecon:targetVocab in order to distinguish when a comprehensive matching process was or was not executed. Note that uwrecon:targetVocabSecondary is favored above void:target and its subproperties when the resource being described is not part of a graph that is a void:Linkset. This property helps build a list of all targets used to insert related assertions about matching entities into the source dataset.
